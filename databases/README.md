### Databases 

Kraken2 for classification depends on a hash-table database. In **XXX** we sought to identify the most suitable database for the purpose of screening for potential pathogenic *Aspergillus*.  

Within this directory, you will find nine databases discussed in our manuscript:
- The **RS** also known as **uR.7**; 
- **EPRSc2** also known as **cRE.21**; 
- **EPRSFv46** also known as **uRE.21**; 
- **EPRSFv46DM** also known as **dRE.21**; 
- **EPRSFv64DM** also kown as **dRE.31**; 
- **EPRSFv64** also known as **uRE.31**; 
- **EPRSFv46MCAspDM** also known as **dREM.258**; 
- **EPRSFv64MCAspDM** also known as **dREM.260**; 

For details on the database compositon we would like to refer to the manuscript itself. Supplementary Table 5 thereby offers details on the construction of each database. Here, we  provide the *seqid2taxid.map* files utilized in creating these nine databases. Thereby, for example, we used the ***RS_seqid2taxid.map*** for the construction of the **RS** database, the ***EPRSc2_seqid2taxid.map*** for the construction of the **EPRSc2**, and so forth.
